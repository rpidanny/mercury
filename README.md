## ‚ú® Features

- **GPX Route Visualization** - Upload your GPX files from Strava, Garmin, and other activity trackers
- **Multiple Shape Options** - Choose from hexagons, squares, or circles for your terrain model
- **Customizable Parameters** - Adjust model width, altitude scaling, grid resolution, and padding
- **Text Embossing** - Add custom text to your 3D model (e.g., date, distance, elevation gain)
- **3D Preview** - Preview your model in the browser before 3D printing
- **STL Export** - Download STL files ready for 3D printing

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and Docker Compose
- [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) (for initial terrain data preparation)

### Setup Terrain Data

1. Download **GeoTIFF** terrain files from [OpenTopography](https://portal.opentopography.org/raster?opentopoID=OTALOS.112016.4326.2).
2. Place the downloaded files in the `data` directory.
3. Create a virtual raster file from your GeoTIFF files:

```bash
# Example for combining Netherlands and Nepal terrain data
gdalbuildvrt data/geo_AW3D30.vrt data/netherlands_AW3D30.tif data/nepal_AW3D30.tif
```

> üí° **Tip:** Download terrain files for the regions where your activities take place.

## üöÄ Usage

### Start the Application

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend services
docker compose up
```

Once running, access the application at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Creating a 3D Model

1. Upload your GPX file
2. Select your desired shape (hexagon, square, or circle)
3. Adjust model parameters:
   - Width (mm) - Physical size of your 3D print
   - Altitude Multiplier - Exaggerate or reduce height differences
   - Grid Resolution - Detail level of terrain (higher = more detailed)
   - Padding Factor - Amount of terrain surrounding your route
4. Add optional embossed text
5. Click "Generate 3D Terrain"
6. Preview your 3D model and download the STL file

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

### Commit Convention

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standards. Commit messages should be structured as follows:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Common types include:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

This convention is enforced both locally through `commitlint` and in the CI pipeline.

### CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- All PRs to main are checked with `commitlint` to ensure they follow the commit message convention
- When changes are merged to the main branch, `semantic-release` automatically:
  - Determines the next version based on commit messages
  - Updates version numbers in both frontend and backend
  - Creates a GitHub release with automatically generated release notes
  - Tags the repository with the new version
