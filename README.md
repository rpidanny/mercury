## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and Docker Compose
- [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) (for initial terrain data preparation)

### Setup Terrain Data

1. Download **GeoTIFF** terrain files from [OpenTopography](https://portal.opentopography.org/raster?opentopoID=OTALOS.112016.4326.2).
2. Place the downloaded files in the `data` directory.
3. Create a virtual raster file from your GeoTIFF files:

```bash
# Example for combining Netherlands and Nepal terrain data
gdalbuildvrt data/geo_AW3D30.vrt data/*.tif
```

The docker-compose.yml assumes that the terrain files are in the `data` directory and the virtual raster file is named `geo_AW3D30.vrt`.

> üí° **Tip:** Download terrain files for the regions where your activities take place.

## üöÄ Usage

### Start the Application

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend services in production mode
docker-compose up
```

Once running, access the application at [http://localhost](http://localhost).

### Development Mode

For development with hot-reloading enabled:

```bash
# Start services in development mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

This will run both the frontend and backend services with full watch mode support, making development faster by automatically reloading changes. Access the development server at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
